# 2.1a-Why Statistics Are Important [to TPC]

## Start Your GH Workflow

Remember, before you start anything else, always follow this GH methodological workflow:

1. Create meaningful **branch** that uses the agreed upon naming scheme: `CHP/X.x--lastname`.
2. Practice the iterative process to **commit** and **push** regularly with meaningful **commit messages**.

## Overview

The *Statistics for Social Justice* book (S4SJ) is written directly to and for social workers—not TPC. However, throughout this course, I am asking us to translate concerns, issues, situations, and methods that we recognize as potentially overlapping and similar with TPC professionals or even be inspired to invent different and new issues and methods for TPC.

The first three readings set us down this inventive path for the future of TPC professionals to take up more data-driven, structural approaches to our work, ***or what could be our work***! Here's a basic rationale and use for each of the readings in the context of this course:

1. The S4SJ book provides us with the initial structure of concepts and statistical techniques to adapt into our own ***structural perspective*** to carry into and inform TPC.
2. Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence discuss and define what they call a social justice ethic. They briefly survey the social justice turn in TPC, and its exigence in response to the myriad ways ethics have been conceptualized and operationalized in TPC's past. This book chapter can help us gain a sense for where TPC has been and where it is going with regards to social justice work.
3. Graham et al's article can serve as an initial bridge for us to see an earlier work that introduces a mixed-methods approach to TPC scholarly research. While I don't expect us to fully understand the entirety of their statistical research method yet, I hope that we can begin to discuss and understand their argument that blends a bit of both the S4SJ structural perspective and TPC's future with a social justice ethic.

With these goals for the texts in mind, please respond to the questions herein about the assigned readings.

## 1. Questions about "Why statistics are important"

### 1.1. Defining key terms

**Question**: Use the space below to define the provided key terms.

- According to the SFSJ authors, what are the main difference between **data** and **information**?:
- **Variable**:
- **Constant**:
- **Conceptualization**:
- **Operationalization**:
- **Nominal level of data**:
- **Ordinal level of data**:
- **Interval level of data**:
- **Ratio level of data**:

### 1.2. On positivism

**Question**: Describe how the S4SJ authors define and use the term **positivism**. How do they suggest it is different from **post-positivism**? According to the authors, why are both paradigms important to social workers? Now, how do you imagine it is important for TPC professionals?

### 4.2. On SGA

**Question**: Summarize the following parts of SGA:

1. What TPC problems SGA addresses,
2. What data they used to demonstrate its potential,
3. What questions SGA data and methods enable TPC to ask, and
4. What methods it uses to do so.

## 5. "Science is a social endeavor."

**Question**: Discuss what this statement means to you. Then, discuss any connections, confusion, and/or questions that you recognize with a SJ ethic and structural perspective?

## 6. Translating the structural approach into TPC / Other Humanities Fields

**Question**: After considering all of these texts -- their exigencies, propositions, and methods -- translate Mullaly's broader definition of the *structural approach* and Moreau's *practice methods* in social work into the domain of TPC or humanist domain of work by putting them into conversation with Lindgren, Gerdes, and Lawrence's SJ ethic and Graham et al's statistical genre analysis. In other words, begin to develop your own structural perspective and set of practices that translates Moreau's 5 practices. Finally, add one new practice approach specific to TPC/your domain.
