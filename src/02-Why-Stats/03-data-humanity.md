# 2.1b-The Humanity of Data: Recognizing the Rhetorics of Data, Queer Data, and Data Feminism

## Start Your GH Workflow

Remember, before you start anything else, always follow this GH methodological workflow:

1. Create meaningful **branch** that uses the agreed upon naming scheme: `CHP/X.x--lastname`.
2. Practice the iterative process to **commit** and **push** regularly with meaningful **commit messages**.

## Overview

In chapter 2.1, we started thinking about translating more quantitive practices into typically humanities-oriented professional practices. In this chapter, we remember the value of humanist values and critical thinking, and I ask that we consider how the two are not mutually exclusive, but are, instead, complimentary and integral for a socially just ethic.

With these goals for the texts in mind, please respond to the questions herein about the assigned readings.
