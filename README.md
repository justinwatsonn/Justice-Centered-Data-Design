# Justice Centered Data Design

This repo serves as a computational textbook for ENGLISH (ENGL) 498 - Justice-Centered Data Design, which is created and taught by Dr. Chris Lindgren.

## How to Use / Getting Started

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) app. Follow the below setup to get this project running locally on your computer.

### 1. Install dependencies

To install the required *dependencies* defined in [package.json](./package.json),

1. Open a Terminal in VS Code.
2. In your Terminal, run:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```

### 2. Start local server

Start the local preview server by running:

```
yarn dev
```

### 3. Visit locally hosted site

Visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your app.

For more information about Observable Framework in general, see their [Getting Started](https://observablehq.com/framework/getting-started) page.

## Project structure

A typical Framework project looks like this:

```ini
.
├─ src
│  ├─ components
│  │  └─ timeline.js           # an importable module
│  ├─ data
│  │  ├─ launches.csv.js       # a data loader
│  │  └─ events.json           # a static data file
│  ├─ example-dashboard.md     # a page
│  ├─ example-report.md        # another page
│  └─ index.md                 # the home page
├─ .gitignore
├─ observablehq.config.js      # the app config file
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

**`src`** - This is the “source root” — where your source files live. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/project-structure#routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`src/index.md`** - This is the home page for your app. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`src/data`** - You can put [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/data-loaders) or static data files anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here.

**`src/components`** - You can put shared [JavaScript modules](https://observablehq.com/framework/imports) anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here. This helps you pull code out of Markdown files and into JavaScript modules, making it easier to reuse code across pages, write tests and run linters, and even share code with vanilla web applications.

**`observablehq.config.js`** - This is the [app configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the app’s title.
